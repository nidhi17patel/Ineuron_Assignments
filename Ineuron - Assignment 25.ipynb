    "\n",
    "map requires a function as its first argument, while list comprehensions work directly with an expression.\n",

    "List comprehensions are often considered more idiomatic and Pythonic for simple transformations.\n",
    "map can be combined with multiple sequences if the function takes multiple arguments.\n",
    "In summary, both map and list comprehensions have their strengths: list comprehensions are concise and Pythonic for simple cases, while map is useful for complex transformations and working with built-in functions. The choice depends on the complexity of the operation and the desired output type (iterator vs. list)."
