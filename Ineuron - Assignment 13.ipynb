    "1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel spreadsheets have several advantages over CSV (Comma-Separated Values) spreadsheets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting: Excel allows you to format cells, columns, and rows, which makes the data more readable and easier to understand. You can add borders, shading, and colors to cells, as well as adjust font styles and sizes. In contrast, CSV files are plain text files, and do not support any formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculations: Excel has built-in formulas and functions that allow you to perform complex calculations on data. For example, you can use the SUM function to add up a column of numbers, or the AVERAGE function to calculate the average value. With CSV files, you need to use a separate tool or programming language to perform calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs and Charts: Excel has a wide range of chart and graph types, which can help you visualize your data and spot trends or patterns. You can create pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, and more. With CSV files, you need to use a separate tool or programming language to create charts and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting and Filtering: Excel allows you to sort and filter your data, making it easier to find the information you need. You can sort by one or more columns, and you can filter by specific criteria. CSV files do not have this capability, and you need to use a separate tool or programming language to sort and filter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Worksheets: Excel allows you to create multiple worksheets within a single workbook, which can be useful for organizing data. With CSV files, you need to create separate files for each worksheet."

    "\n",
    "you need to pass file objects to the csv.reader() and csv.writer() functions, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create a reader object to read data from a CSV file named data.csv, you would use the following code:\n",

    "delimiter is a character or string that separates values in a sequence. For example, in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, the comma is used as the delimiter to separate the values in each row. Other examples of delimiters include semicolons, tabs, and pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "line_terminator is a sequence of characters that indicates the end of a line. In most operating systems, the line terminator consists of two characters: a carriage return (\\r) and a line feed (\\n). However, different operating systems may use different sequences, such as only a carriage return or only a line feed."
