    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a structured approach for designing software by modeling real-world entities as objects. OOP aims to make code more modular, reusable, and maintainable through concepts like abstraction (focusing on essentials), encapsulation (bundling data and behavior), inheritance (reusing and extending classes), and polymorphism (interchangeable interfaces). It promotes code organization, teamwork, and real-world modeling, making software design more efficient and adaptable."
