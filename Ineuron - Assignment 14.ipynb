    "1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "RGBA stands for \"Red Green Blue Alpha\". It is a color model used in digital image processing and computer graphics to represent colors with transparency. The first three components (red, green, and blue) represent the primary colors of light, and the fourth component (alpha) represents the level of transparency or opacity of the color. The alpha value is usually represented as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating complete transparency and 1 indicating complete opacity."
